STC 15F2K60S2
28I-PDIP40
1845HVV065.XD

STC The program Flash in user program area can not be used as EEPROM., but there are special EEPROM
15 STC 1T 8051 MCU, Speed is 8~12 times faster than the traditional 8051 in the same working frequency
F : Operating Voltage 5.5V~4.2V
2K SRAM: 2K = 2048 E\WHV
60 Program space, e.g. 60:60KB
S2˖ 2 UARTs (can be used simultaneously)ˈ SPIˈ Internal EEPROMˈ  A/D Converter(PWM also can be used as DAC)ˈ  CCP/PWM/PCA

28 : Up to 28MHz
I : Industrial, -40ć-85ć
PDIP 40

In Keil C development environment, select the Intel 8052 to compiling and only contain < reg51.h > as header file

Type Program Memory
STC15F/L2K60S2 0000H~0EFFFH (60K)

STC15F2K60S2 on-chip RAM SRAM (Byte) 2K (256 <idata> + 1792 <xdata>) on-chip expanded RAM 1792 
Can 64K bytes external expanded RAM be accessed - Yes

About STC MCU Compiler/Assembler :
1. Any traditional compiler / assembler and the popular Keil C51 are suitable for STC MCU.
2. For selection MCU body, the traditional compiler / assembler, you can choose Intel's 8052 / 87C52 / 87C52
/ 87C58 or Philips's P87C52 / P87C54/P87C58 in the traditional environment, in Keil environment, you
can choose the types in front of the proposed or download the STC chips database file (STC.CDB) from the
STC official website

If you are just playing around I would suggest IAP15W4K61S4-30I-PDIP40, which is the flagship of their entire product line, pin-to-pin compatible with other STC15 chips in DIP-40 package, supports on-chip debug, and have Von Newmann-connected internal ROM (through the use of EEPROM access registers)
Or if you are okay with a bit less than the best, I can send you a IAP15L2K61S2-28I-PDIP40 - the extra I got from the sample order. That chip runs only at 3.3V (instead of 2.7-5.5V range for the STC15W variant,) have 2 UARTs instead of 4 and half the RAM.
